ROAMPAL vs PLAIN VECTOR DATABASE - Statistical Significance Test
================================================================================

HYPOTHESIS: Outcome-based learning improves retrieval quality
            over pure semantic similarity search.

TEST DESIGN:
  - 30 scenarios with misleading queries
  - Queries semantically match BAD advice better
  - Success = GOOD advice ranked #1 despite semantic disadvantage

CONTROL:   Plain ChromaDB (pure L2 distance)
TREATMENT: Roampal (outcome scoring + dynamic weights)

ERROR: This test requires real embeddings.
Install: pip install sentence-transformers
